# Security model

This document describes the threat model, what `agy-mcp` defends, and
what it explicitly does **not** defend. Read this before changing
anything in `safety.py`, `worktree.py`, `install.py`, or
`utils.safe_write_text`.

## Threat model

The bridge sits between two trust boundaries:

1. **Caller → bridge** (Claude Code / Codex → MCP stdio): the caller is
   trusted with the user's repo and shell, but the prompt content may
   be adversarial (user input, scraped issue body, etc.). The bridge
   must not let a hostile prompt escape its sandbox.
2. **Bridge → agy** (subprocess launch): the bridge controls argv,
   environment, and cwd. The `agy` binary itself is trusted (it was
   installed by the user) but its responses are NOT — they're streamed
   back into the caller's transcript.

The bridge is **not** a sandbox for `agy` — that's `agy --sandbox`'s
job. It's a hardened gateway that:

- Refuses requests likely to leak secrets or perform destructive
  operations.
- Scrubs response and error content before returning to the caller.
- Isolates write-enabled `execute` runs in a disposable git worktree.

## Layered defences

### 1. Request validation (`models.py::BridgeRequest`)

Pydantic v2 with `extra="forbid"`. Notable validators:

- `extra_env` (passed through to `agy` subprocess): keys must match
  `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`, values cannot contain `\n` / `\r` / NUL, max
  64 entries, max 4096 chars per value. Rejects the POSIX-special `_`
  key. (Phase 5 R2 sec P0-1.)
- `prompt`: capped length; pattern-matched against a deny-list.
- `mode`, `backend`, `output_protocol`: closed enums.
- `timeout`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 86400.
- `max_output_chars`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 1_000_000.

### 2. Deny-list (`safety.py::SafetyPolicy`)

Reads from / mentions of sensitive paths are refused outright in
`execute` mode and warned in other modes:

- `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.gnupg/`, `~/.config/gh/`
- Browser cookie stores (`~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome`,
  `~/.mozilla/firefox/.../cookies.sqlite`, etc.)
- OS keychain (`security find-generic-password`, `secret-tool`)
- Destructive command shapes: `rm -rf /`, `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/...`,
  `mkfs`, `:(){:|:&};:`, etc.

The deny-list is applied to both the prompt body AND the synthesised
argv (defence-in-depth: a prompt that ends up in `--extra-args` still
gets scanned).

### 3. argv injection (`bridge.py` + `adapters/agy.py`)

Every flag that takes a value is fused as `--flag=value` instead of
two argv items (`--flag`, `value`). This stops a malicious value from
being parsed as a new flag. The fused form is what we pass to
`subprocess.Popen(shell=False)`.

### 4. Subprocess hygiene

- `shell=False` always; argv only.
- `start_new_session=True` (POSIX) / `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
  (Windows) so cancellation can `killpg(SIGTERM)` / send
  `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` without losing the whole tree.
- `stdin=DEVNULL` — `agy` is never given interactive input.
- Environment is **filtered**, not inherited: start from
  `os.environ.copy()`, drop secret-bearing names (`*_TOKEN`,
  `*_API_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `AWS_*`, `GCP_*`, `AZURE_*`, `OPENAI_*`,
  `ANTHROPIC_*`, etc.), then layer the caller's validated `extra_env`.

### 5. File-write primitive (`utils.py::safe_write_text`)

Used by `session_store`, `install`, and `worktree`. Defends against
parent-symlink swaps:

- Pre-write walk: every component from `verify_under` down to
  `path.parent` is checked with `is_symlink()` (lstat semantics — does
  NOT collapse in-root symlinks the way `resolve()` would).
- Tempfile opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` where supported.
- Atomic `os.replace`.
- Post-replace walk: re-walks parents and re-checks
  `relative_to(verify_under)` on the resolved path. This is a
  **detect-after-the-fact** signal — an attacker who wins the race
  has already published their leaf, but the raise surfaces the breach
  to the caller via a structured `OSError`.

The airtight `openat`-based variant is logged in
`docs/review-followups.md` for a future phase.

### 6. Worktree isolation (`worktree.py`)

When `mode=execute` and `allow_write=True`, the bridge:

- Creates `<repo>/.agy-mcp/worktrees/<session_id>/` with
  `git worktree add` on a fresh branch.
- Passes `--add-dir <worktree>` to `agy` so the agent's edits land
  there.
- Removes the worktree on session finalise (success, failure, or
  cancel), even if the agent crashed mid-run.

Configurable via `~/.config/agy-mcp/config.toml`:

```toml
[execute]
worktree_default = true     # opt-out via false
allow_write_default = false # opt-in via true (still requires per-call allow_write=True)
```

Env var overrides: `AGY_MCP_WORKTREE_DEFAULT=0/1`,
`AGY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE_DEFAULT=0/1`.

### 7. Output redaction (`safety.py::SafetyPolicy.redact`)

Every string that leaves the process (`error`, `warnings`,
`agent_messages`, `installed[*].path`, `command_preview`, log lines):

- PEM blocks → `<REDACTED PEM>`
- JWT tokens → `<REDACTED JWT>`
- AWS access key IDs (`AKIA...`) → `<REDACTED AWS AKID>`
- `Bearer <token>` / `Authorization: ...` → `<REDACTED AUTHZ>`
- `/Users/<u>/` → `~/`, `/home/<u>/` → `~/`, `C:\Users\<u>\` → `~\`

Compiled patterns are cached behind an RLock so two concurrent MCP
tool calls cannot race on first redaction.

### 8. MCP tool surface guards (`server.py`)

- `agy_install_skill`: `targets` capped at 16 entries, each rejected
  unless it is `str` and `in {"claude", "codex", "antigravity", "all"}`.
  `scope` allow-listed. `project_root` validated (leaf is not a
  symlink) before `install_skills` runs. Deliberate
  defence-in-depth with `_expand_targets` doing the same allow-list
  check (Phase 7 R1 arch P2-2).
- `agy_status` / `agy_read` / `agy_cancel`: `job_id` must match
  `^job_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,80}$`. Oversized values are rejected with a
  structured error.
- All sync tools route through `_structured_failure` on exception —
  never a bare traceback to the caller.

## What is NOT defended

Documenting what the bridge does NOT defend prevents callers from
assuming protection that isn't there.

- **Compromised `agy` binary.** If `agy` itself is hostile, the bridge
  cannot detect it. We probe `agy --help` / `agy --version` once for
  capability detection and trust the output.
- **Caller-side prompt leaks.** The caller can paste the bridge's
  response wherever it likes. We redact secrets before returning, but
  if the response is logged into an external system the caller is on
  the hook.
- **`AGY_BRIDGE_CMD` env var.** This is an advanced override consumed
  by `skills/.../scripts/agy_bridge.py` that lets the forwarder shell
  out to an arbitrary command. Treat it as a trust boundary: anything
  with `AGY_BRIDGE_CMD` set can run that command with the user's
  privileges.
- **Editable installs.** `pip install -e .` / `uv pip install -e .`
  makes `_skill_bodies/` read from the working tree at install time,
  so a hostile working tree feeds hostile install content. By design
  — the developer is trusted on their own machine.
- **TOCTOU residue after a successful race.** `safe_write_text`'s
  post-walk surfaces the breach to the caller (via a raised
  `OSError`) but does NOT undo the published-leaf state. The
  `openat`-based airtight fix is earmarked for a future phase.
- **The `@main` pin in `scripts/agy_bridge.py`'s `uvx` fallback.** A
  force-push to `main` flips behaviour silently for users on the
  fallback path. The docstring calls this out; bump to a tag at
  release.
- **System-level symlinks on macOS / Linux.** `/tmp/...` →
  `/private/tmp/...` and `/var/...` → `/private/var/...` are honest
  symlinks but they exist on every macOS install. `_validate_project_root`
  intentionally does not refuse paths whose ancestors include such
  symlinks; the write-time `safe_write_text` walk under the resolved
  root provides the real defence.

## Audit hooks

The session store records every job, including:

- The redacted `command_preview` (argv after `_structured_failure`'s
  redact pass).
- The full `events.jsonl` stream (raw canonical events, never
  truncated).
- `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `agy.log` (the klog file).
- `meta.json` with `created_at`, `updated_at`, `exit_code`,
  `cancel_reason`.

An operator can review past runs with `agy_sessions()` +
`agy_read(job_id, translate="raw")` without needing the original
caller's transcript.
